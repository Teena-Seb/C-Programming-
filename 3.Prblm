Get a Date of Birth from the user which is an 8-digit number (DDMMYYYY). Check whether it is a Lucky number or not by following the steps below:
Step-1: Calculate the sum of the digits in the odd-numbered positions (the first, third, fifth, and seventh digits) and multiply this sum by 3.
Step-2: Calculate the sum of the digits in the even-numbered positions (the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth digits) 
and add this to the previous result (got in step 1).
Given Date of Birth is declared as a 'lucky number', only if the last digit of the result from step 2 is 0.
Develop a program to read the Date of Birth, if the number of digits is not 8 then print “Cannot be processed” and terminate the program. 
If the number of digits is 8 and if the DOB is a lucky number, output the DOB with the message “Lucky Number.”
If the number of digits is 8 and if the DOB is not a lucky number, output the DOB with the message “Not a Lucky Number.”

int main(){
    int a[8],n,i,su=0,sum=0,summ=0,ct=0;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int tp=n;
    while(tp!=0){
        tp/=10;
        ct++;
    }
    if(ct!=8)
        printf("Invalid Input");
    else{
        for(i=0; i<8; i++){
            a[i]=n%10;
            n=n/10;
        }
        for(i=0;i<8;i++){
            if(i%2==0)
                su+=a[i];
            else
                sum+=a[i];
        }
        summ=su+(sum*3);
        if(summ%10==0)
            printf("Lucky Number");
        else
            printf("Not a Lucky Number");
