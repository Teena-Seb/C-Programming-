The Earthquake Research Institute of Japan has recorded an earthquake that occurred in the year 2022 using the Richter scale.
Develop a program to get the ’n’ (number of times) the earthquake has occurred and print the number of times in which the magnitude
was low, medium, and high. The magnitude value is given in microns. If the value is less than 5.4(inclusive) in microns then it is low, 5.4 to 7.0 (inclusive) 
is medium and more than 7.0 it is high. Also, if the number of times recorded is Zero, display as “No earthquake predicted” and if the number of times
recorded is negative, display as “Invalid Input”.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main(){
    int n,i=0;
    int cl=0,cm=0,ch=0;
    float mag[100];
    scanf("%d",&n);
    if(n<0){
        printf("Invalid Input");
        exit(0);
    }
    else if(n==0){
        printf("No earthquake predicted");
        exit(0);
    }
    else if(n>0){
        for(i=0; i<n; i++){
            scanf("%f", &mag[i]);
            if(mag[i]<=5.4)
                cl++;
            else if(mag[i]>5.4 && mag[i]<=7.0)
                cm++;
            else
                ch++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n%d\n%d",cl,cm,ch);
}
